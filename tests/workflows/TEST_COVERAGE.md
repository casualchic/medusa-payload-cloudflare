# Workflow Test Coverage Report

## Files Under Test

1. `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml`
2. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

## Test Statistics

- **Total Test Cases**: 60+
- **Test Categories**: 9
- **Lines of Test Code**: ~500

## Coverage Breakdown

### 1. Claude Code Review Workflow (18 tests)
- ✅ File existence and readability
- ✅ Workflow naming and triggers
- ✅ Path filter configuration (NEW: validates enabled filters)
- ✅ Job configuration and runner
- ✅ Security permissions
- ✅ Step configuration
- ✅ Secret management
- ✅ Claude-specific configuration
- ✅ YAML syntax validation

**Key Test**: Validates that path filters are NOT commented out (regression prevention)

### 2. Deploy Workflow (22 tests)
- ✅ File existence and readability
- ✅ Workflow naming and triggers
- ✅ Job configuration and permissions
- ✅ Environment variable setup
- ✅ Node.js and pnpm setup
- ✅ Caching strategy (NEW: Next.js cache validation)
- ✅ Dependency installation
- ✅ Linting and testing steps
- ✅ Build configuration (NEW: PR build validation)
- ✅ Deployment conditional logic
- ✅ Secret fallbacks (NEW)
- ✅ YAML syntax validation

**Key Tests**: 
- Next.js cache with source file hashing
- Build runs on PRs without conditional
- PAYLOAD_SECRET fallback for CI

### 3. Cross-Workflow Consistency (4 tests)
- ✅ Consistent action versions
- ✅ Security best practices
- ✅ Runner consistency
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials

### 4. Optimization and Performance (4 tests)
- ✅ Caching strategy implementation
- ✅ Deterministic cache keys
- ✅ Shallow clone optimization
- ✅ Frozen lockfile usage

### 5. Workflow Trigger Configuration (2 tests)
- ✅ Claude workflow path filters
- ✅ Deploy workflow trigger scope

### 6. Step Dependencies and Order (2 tests)
- ✅ Deploy workflow step order
- ✅ Claude workflow step order

## Edge Cases Covered

1. **YAML Syntax Errors**
   - Tab detection (YAML requires spaces)
   - Unbalanced quotes
   - Indentation validation

2. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Hardcoded credentials detection
   - Permission over-granting
   - Secret exposure

3. **Configuration Regressions**
   - Commented-out path filters
   - Missing cache configurations
   - Incorrect conditional logic

4. **Performance Issues**
   - Missing caching
   - Non-deterministic cache keys
   - Deep git clones

## Test Methodology

### Positive Testing
- Validates expected configurations exist
- Checks for required security measures
- Ensures optimization features are present

### Negative Testing
- Verifies deprecated patterns are removed
- Ensures sensitive data isn't hardcoded
- Checks that conditionals are correctly placed

### Regression Testing
- Path filters enabled (not commented)
- Build runs on PRs
- Cache includes source files

## Failure Scenarios

Tests will fail if:
1. Workflow files are missing or unreadable
2. Required security permissions are missing
3. Secrets are hardcoded instead of using `${{ secrets.* }}`
4. Path filters are disabled when they should be enabled
5. Build step is conditional when it should run on all PRs
6. Cache configuration is missing or incomplete
7. YAML syntax errors are present
8. Step order is incorrect

## Continuous Integration

These tests run automatically:
- On every commit to a PR
- As part of the main test suite (`pnpm test`)
- Before deployment

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
1. Schema validation using JSON Schema for GitHub Actions
2. Validation of action versions against known vulnerabilities
3. Performance benchmarking for workflow execution time
4. Integration with GitHub API to validate secrets exist
5. Automated workflow optimization suggestions

## Maintenance

When updating workflows:
1. Run tests locally: `pnpm run test:workflows`
2. Update tests if changing workflow structure
3. Add new tests for new features
4. Ensure all tests pass before merging
