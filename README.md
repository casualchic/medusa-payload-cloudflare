## üéØ Why Meridian?

Just as a **meridian** represents the sun's highest point‚Äîpeak performance‚Äî**Meridian Commerce** achieves the optimal balance between enterprise features and startup costs.

Meridian is the **first production-ready** implementation of Medusa.js e-commerce with Payload CMS running on Cloudflare Workers. We solved the hard problems so you don't have to:

- ‚úÖ **Virtual filesystem** for Cloudflare Workers (no traditional file access)
- ‚úÖ **Custom build patches** for Next.js compatibility
- ‚úÖ **Edge runtime middleware** that actually works
- ‚úÖ **D1 + R2 integration** with Payload CMS
- ‚úÖ **12x cost reduction** vs Vercel/Railway

### The Problem We Solved

Traditional e-commerce stacks require Docker, VPS hosting, or expensive serverless platforms ($40-60/month minimum). Running Next.js + Payload + Medusa on Cloudflare Workers requires solving several technical challenges:

1. **No filesystem access** - Workers can't read files at runtime
2. **Import.meta.url undefined** - Breaks many Node.js modules
3. **Edge runtime limitations** - Dynamic code generation not allowed
4. **Build tool incompatibilities** - OpenNext.js needs patching for Workers

Meridian solves all of these with production-tested solutions.

## üí∞ Cost Comparison

| Platform | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| **Cloudflare Workers** (Meridian) | **~$5** | D1 + R2 + Workers included |
| Vercel | $40-60 | Hobby limits too restrictive |
| Railway | $50-80 | Per-service pricing |
| DigitalOcean + Docker | $30-50 | Manual DevOps required |

**The Meridian advantage:** Peak performance at the optimal price point.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React 19 (Server Components)
- **CMS**: Payload CMS 3.61 with D1 SQLite database
- **E-commerce**: Medusa.js backend integration
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 for media assets
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (distributed SQLite)
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Workers via OpenNext.js

### Key Technical Innovations

1. **Virtual Filesystem** (`scripts/patch-middleware-handler.cjs`)
   - Inlines all Next.js manifest files into the worker bundle
   - Intercepts `fs.readFileSync()` calls to serve from memory
   - Solves Workers' lack of traditional filesystem access

2. **Build Patches**
   - `scripts/patch-opentelemetry.cjs` - Removes telemetry (breaks in Workers)
   - `scripts/patch-middleware-tracer.cjs` - Fixes middleware bundling
   - `scripts/patch-middleware-handler.cjs` - Handles `import.meta.url` edge cases

3. **Edge-Compatible Middleware**
   - No dynamic code generation (`eval()`)
   - Simplified routing for Workers runtime
   - Compatible with Cloudflare's V8 isolates

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.19.0+
- pnpm 9+ or 10+
- Cloudflare account (free tier works)
- Medusa backend (use [Medusa Cloud](https://medusajs.com/cloud/) or self-host)

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/casualchic/medusa-payload-cloudflare.git meridian
cd meridian
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local`:

```bash
# Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
PAYLOAD_SECRET=your-secret-here

# Your Medusa backend URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL=https://your-medusa-backend.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_your-key-here

# Optional: For GDPR-compliant logging
LOG_SECRET=your-log-secret-here
```

### 3. Local Development

```bash
# Start dev server
pnpm dev

# Access at:
# - Storefront: http://localhost:3000
# - Admin Panel: http://localhost:3000/admin
```

### 4. Deploy to Cloudflare

```bash
# Authenticate
pnpm wrangler login

# Deploy (first time - creates D1 database & R2 bucket)
CLOUDFLARE_ENV=production pnpm run deploy

# Subsequent deploys
CLOUDFLARE_ENV=production pnpm run deploy:app
```
