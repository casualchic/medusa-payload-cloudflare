### r/nextjs
**Title:** Meridian: Production-ready Medusa + Payload + Next.js 15 on Cloudflare Workers ($5/month)

```markdown
Hey r/nextjs! I just open sourced Meridian - a complete e-commerce stack running on Cloudflare Workers.

## What is it?

A production-ready implementation of:
- Next.js 15 with React 19 Server Components
- Payload CMS for content management
- Medusa.js for e-commerce
- Cloudflare Workers + D1 + R2

Total hosting cost: **~$5/month** (vs $60/month on traditional platforms)

## Why I built it

I got tired of paying $60+/month for simple e-commerce sites. Cloudflare Workers seemed perfect, but getting Next.js + Payload + Medusa to work was a nightmare.

Spent months solving:
- Virtual filesystem (Workers can't read files at runtime)
- import.meta.url undefined issues
- Edge runtime middleware compatibility
- Build tool patching

All of this is now open sourced so you don't have to solve it yourself.

## What makes it interesting?

1. **Virtual Filesystem Implementation** - Inlines Next.js manifests into the worker bundle
2. **Custom Build Patches** - Automated patches for OpenTelemetry, middleware, etc.
3. **Production-Tested** - Running in production for months
4. **Comprehensive Docs** - 12+ guides covering everything

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15
- Payload CMS 3.61
- Medusa.js
- Cloudflare Workers, D1, R2
- TypeScript, Vitest, Playwright

Happy to answer any questions about the implementation or architecture!

### r/cloudflare
**Title:** First production-ready Next.js 15 + Payload CMS + Medusa on Workers

```markdown
After months of fighting with Next.js on Workers, I've finally got a production-ready e-commerce stack working.

Just open sourced the whole thing: https://github.com/casualchic/medusa-payload-cloudflare

## The Hard Parts (Solved)

**Virtual Filesystem:**
Workers don't have traditional file access. Solved by inlining all Next.js manifests into the bundle and intercepting `fs.readFileSync()` calls.

**Import.meta.url:**
Undefined in Workers context, breaks many Node.js modules. Patched during build with fallbacks.

**Edge Runtime Middleware:**
Dynamic code generation isn't allowed. Simplified middleware to avoid eval() and other incompatible patterns.

## Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router + RSC)
- Payload CMS (D1 database)
- Medusa.js (e-commerce)
- R2 for media storage

## Cost Comparison

- Cloudflare: ~$5/month
- Vercel: $60/month
- Railway: $80/month

## Performance

- Global edge deployment
- <100ms TTFB
- Zero cold starts (D1 + R2)

Check it out and let me know what you think! Also happy to answer technical questions about the implementation.
```

### r/webdev
**Title:** Open sourced our $5/month e-commerce stack (Next.js + Cloudflare Workers)

```markdown
We run a production e-commerce site for $5/month on Cloudflare Workers.

Just open sourced the entire stack: https://github.com/casualchic/medusa-payload-cloudflare

## Why This Matters

Traditional e-commerce hosting is expensive:
- Vercel: $60/mo minimum for serious traffic
- Railway: $80/mo for comparable resources
- VPS: $30-50/mo + DevOps time

Cloudflare Workers changes this completely.

## The Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 + React 19
- **CMS:** Payload CMS with D1 SQLite
- **E-commerce:** Medusa.js integration
- **Storage:** R2 for media
- **Deployment:** Workers (serverless)

## Technical Highlights

We solved several hard problems:
1. Virtual filesystem for Workers
2. Next.js build compatibility
3. Edge runtime middleware
4. D1/R2 integration with Payload

All documented and open sourced (MIT).

## Features

‚úÖ Full product catalog
‚úÖ Shopping cart
‚úÖ Customer accounts
‚úÖ Flexible CMS
‚úÖ Multi-region support
‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline
‚úÖ Comprehensive tests

Perfect for:
- Side projects on a budget
- MVPs that need to scale
- Learning edge computing

Questions welcome!

## üí¨ Hacker News Post

**Title:** Meridian: Production e-commerce stack on Cloudflare Workers for $5/month

```
Hi HN! I'm sharing Meridian, a production-ready e-commerce stack built on Cloudflare Workers that costs ~$5/month to run instead of the typical $60+.

GitHub: https://github.com/casualchic/medusa-payload-cloudflare

## Background

I run a small e-commerce business and was frustrated with hosting costs. Vercel wanted $60/month, Railway was $80/month, and self-hosting required DevOps time I didn't have.

Cloudflare Workers seemed perfect - global edge deployment, pay-per-use pricing, D1 database, R2 storage. But getting a full stack working (Next.js + CMS + E-commerce) required solving several hard problems.

## Technical Challenges

**1. No Filesystem Access**
Workers run in V8 isolates without traditional file access. Next.js expects to read manifests at runtime. Solution: Virtual filesystem that inlines manifests into the bundle and intercepts fs.readFileSync() calls.

**2. import.meta.url Undefined**
Many Node.js modules break when import.meta.url is undefined. Solution: Build-time patches with intelligent fallbacks.

**3. Edge Runtime Limitations**
Dynamic code generation (eval, new Function) isn't allowed. Solution: Simplified middleware avoiding these patterns.

**4. OpenTelemetry Incompatibility**
Next.js bundles telemetry that breaks in Workers. Solution: Automated removal during build.

## What's Included

- Next.js 15 with React 19 Server Components
- Payload CMS (headless CMS with D1 database)
- Medusa.js integration (e-commerce backend)
- Cloudflare R2 (media storage)
- Complete test suite (unit, integration, E2E)
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Comprehensive documentation

## Cost Breakdown

Cloudflare Workers pricing for ~10k requests/day:
- Workers: Free tier (100k req/day)
- D1: $0.75/month (5GB storage)
- R2: $0.15/month (1GB storage)
- Total: ~$1-5/month depending on usage

Compare to:
- Vercel: $60/month (Pro tier for serious traffic)
- Railway: $80/month (similar resources)
- DigitalOcean: $30/month + maintenance time

## Production Status

This powers a real e-commerce site that's been running for months. It's not a toy project - it's production-tested with real traffic and transactions.

MIT licensed. Contributions welcome!

I'm happy to answer questions about the architecture, implementation challenges, or Cloudflare Workers in general.

‚Ä¢ Medusa.js e-commerce
‚Ä¢ Cloudflare Workers + D1 + R2

**Key Innovations:**
‚úÖ Virtual filesystem implementation
‚úÖ Edge-compatible middleware

## üìß Email to Payload Team

**Subject:** Meridian: Production Payload + Medusa on Cloudflare Workers (OSS)

```
Hey Payload Team,

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to share a project I just open sourced that might interest the community.

**Meridian** is a production-ready implementation of Payload CMS + Medusa e-commerce + Next.js 15 running on Cloudflare Workers.

GitHub: https://github.com/casualchic/medusa-payload-cloudflare

Key highlights:
- Payload 3.61 with D1 SQLite database
- R2 storage for media
- Custom build patches for Workers compatibility
- ~$5/month hosting cost
- Comprehensive documentation

The integration with Payload was surprisingly smooth - the D1 adapter worked great. I built a flexible page builder with 7 content blocks that makes managing product pages really nice.

Would love to see this in the Payload showcase if you think it's a good fit!

Also happy to write a case study or blog post about the implementation if that's useful.

Thanks for building such a great CMS!

Best,
Ian
```
